# coding-challenge-front-end

Welcome to the Cove coding challenge! üëã

Adam just signed a deal with a large real estate owner üéâ. Before we can launch our *powered by cove* platform in their office building, we need to get a reservation system up and going.

In our backlog grooming Jeremy (our Product person) presented the problem we are trying solve for our users:

*As Angela at Allsafe (office user), I‚Äôd like to book a the large conference room for the strategy meeting and I need to find a time when it's avaiable.*

The team broke this problem down and decided to start first with this User Story:
- As an office user, I‚Äôd like to see the schedule for a selected room and date, because I need to find a time when it's available.

For this challenge, we've provided you with a simple application that is meant to display a list of reservations and allows the user to filter by date and room. Your job is to complete this application so that it functions as intended.

Questions along the way? Don't hesitate to reach out to engineering@cove.is!

## Running the App

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Part 1

Your first objective is to take a look at the TODOs in [`App.js`](./src/App.js) and "wire-up" the existing components. No need to change the UI at this stage in terms of styling or functionality, apart from hooking up the components.

We'd like you to use hooks for this section. Specifically we'd like you to use the `useMemo` hook in your solution. If you don't know what this hook is you can read about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo).

You'll need to:
- manage the state for both filters (`DatePicker` & `DropDownSelect`)
- fetch a list of reservations from this endpoint: https://cove-coding-challenge-api.herokuapp.com/reservations
- populate `DropDownSelect` with options based on the rooms you get back from the endpoint (e.g. "Room A", "Room B", ...)
- pass a filtered version of the reservations you get back to `ReservationList`

After this step, the user should be able to change the value of both filters, and they should only see reservations that match their filters.

### Explain your approach to Part 1

In this first step, I added some dependencies like moment (to handle dates) and Axios (to fetch the API). Also, I took an approach where I separate the services and configure the base with a base URL with Axios, making it easier for future URL changes etc. without having to mess with the service layer or components. In addition, I created the memoized value with the filters passed by the user using the useMemo hook and stored the filter value in the state, with this we only redo the "calculation" once some hook dependency changes and for that I added the exhaustive plugin dependency hooks in eslint to help with this. Finally, the reservations are fetched only once, in the component mount.

## Part 2

Your next job is to make the list of reservations look a little nicer. Ryan, the designer on our team made some mock-ups for the desktop and mobile UI. Take a look at the TODO in [`ReservationList.js`](./src/ReservationList.js) and try to match Ryan's mock-ups below. Your design should be responsive, using a css breakpoint to switch between the desktop and mobile layouts.


Desktop:

<img src="public/imgs/mock-up-desktop.png" alt="desktop" />

Mobile:

<img src="public/imgs/mock-up-mobile.png" alt="mobile" width="300"/>

Please don't worry about making it a pixel-perfect match with the designs! As Devs we collaborate closely with Ryan and it's a give and take.

Feel free to use whatever approach to styling you wish. No need to mirror what is already in the project. Some approaches that we consider valid:

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React-JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.6.0)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- SASS/LESS
- CSS Modules
- or just plain CSS

### Explain your approach to Part 2

In this step I added styles in the app following the mockups using styled-components. I used the mobile-first technique to add the styles improving the UX and flex design with media queries for mobile version.

## Part 3

For this last step, we'd like to try and understand how you approach testing. Our product person Jeremy already has a bunch of reservations related User Stories lined up. In the backlog grooming, Wil pointed out that we should add some good test coverage now, since we'll likely add more complexity to our reservation app in the future.

We've started working on a util called `isScheduleConflict` to check for reservation conflicts. `isScheduleConflict` takes a list of reservations and returns `true` if any reservation in the list conflicts with another in the list (see `utils.js` for more details). Your job is to complete this util and add more test coverage. Look for the TODOs in [`utils.js`](src/utils.js) and [`utils.test.js`](src/utils.test.js) and use `yarn test` to execute the tests.

Assumptions you can make:
- `reservations` will always be an array of valid reservations
- A valid reservation always has a start/end time and the end time will always be after the start time
- Do NOT hook up the util to the user interface

NOTE: Don't worry about the efficiency of your solution:
- If you know an efficient solution, we'd love to see it and hear why you favor it.
- However, we are more focused on readable and maintainable code.

### Explain your approach to Part 3

In this step, I go through the array twice using the forEach function and inside the second forEach function I check if the index of the elements are in order to ensure that the comparison is being made between different elements. Once two conflicting reservations are found, the function returns true and stops traversing the array, thus giving a performance gain, otherwise it continues traversing the elements and always changing the value of the isOverlap variable that will be returned at the end as false if none is found. conflicting reservation

## One last thing...

Write up a few notes about your approach to each Part in the README sections above. Finally, search the repo for `TODO:`. If you see no search results, then you are done! üëè
